# Applied Predictive Modeling - Predicting Cervical Cancer (Risk Factors)

--- 

## About <a name = "about"></a>
Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer among women worldwide, with approximately 570,000 new cases and 311,000 deaths in 2018 alone. Most of these cases are reported in low-and middle-income countries, where access to early detection and treatment is often inadequate. Notably, cervical cancer is largely preventable with timely detection and treatment. Hence, enhancing early detection and diagnosis remains a critical aspect of combating this disease. Machine Learning, a subfield of Artificial Intelligence (AI), has shown enormous promise in improving cancer diagnostics. ML algorithms can analyze vast amounts of data to detect patterns, trends, and correlations that may not be readily evident to human observers. This study aims to develop an ML model specifically tailored for diagnosing cervical cancer and evaluate its accuracy and efficiency.
